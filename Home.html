            <p >
                Sri Lanka's tea industry dates back to the 19th century and is one of the largest and most important industries in the country,
                 employing over a million people and contributing significantly to the economy. The tea is grown in the central highlands
                  and is renowned for its unique flavor and aroma. Sri Lanka produces black and green tea, with black tea dominating production.
                  Despite challenges such as unpredictable weather and declining prices, the industry remains a vital part of the country's economy
                   and culturalheritage. It promotes Sri Lanka as a top producer of high-quality tea and maintains a significant role in the global tea market.

            <h2>Story of Ceylon Tea</h2>
            <p >
                James Taylor arrived in Ceylon in 1852, settling down at the Loolecondera Estate, Galaha.
                 He begins a 19-acre tea plantation on the Loolecondera Estate in 1867, laying the foundation 
                 for what would become Sri Lankas largest export industry for over a century.
In 1872, a fully equipped tea factory began operating on the Loolecondera Estate.
 In 1873, Ceylon Tea made its international debut when twenty-three pounds of tea produced by James Taylor reached London.

            <h2> Regions Of Tea Cultivation </h2>
            <p >
               Ceylon tea and the tea produced in each Sri Lankan region have unique characteristics resulting from differing
                climates and elevations. Kandy is famous for mid-grown teas with a variety of strengths and styles, depending
                 on elevation. Lower elevation produces large, strong-flavored leaves, while higher elevation produces smaller,
                  mild and delicate leaves.
Uva region tea has a distinctive flavor used mainly in blends, and is known as low-grown tea grown below 2000ft.
 The region's soil and low elevation result in rapid growth of tea bushes and beautiful, long leaves ideal for rolling.

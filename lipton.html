      <h2>Market Growth</h2>
      <p> Tea has been very popular in the emerging market, owing to prevalence of tea culture.
         Furthermore, growth in health awareness and increase in the disposable income has aided
          the tea market growth. Moreover, introduction of additional healthy ingredients in tea by 
          different market players are some other factors that drive the growth of the market.
           However, increase in trend of coffee consumption and fluctuating prices of raw materials
            caused by unpredictable climatic conditions act as the major restraint for this market.
             On the contrary, growth in demand for herbal tea and introduction of new flavor & variety of
              tea is anticipated to provide growth opportunities for the tea market.

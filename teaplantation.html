            Tea grown in this region comes from Nuwara Eliya and Kandy. In Nuwara Eliya tea is grown at an elevation of 6,
            200ft above sea level and has rare and refined qualities that differs from the low-grown teas. As a result of
             the higher altitudes and low-temperatures, Nuwara Eliya produces slow-grown bushes with rather small leaves 
             which takes on an orange hue after withering. The infused tea leaves take on a greenish-yellow and has a pale
              liquor compared to other Ceylon Teas. Kandy is famous for mid-grown teas and is also responsible for producing
               flavorsome teas. Kandy produces a variety of strengths and styles, and it all depends on the elevation of
                which the tea is grown at, tea grown at a lower elevation produces a rather large leaf and has a strong 
                flavor when infused and tea grown at a higher elevation produces a smaller leaf and has a mild and delicate
                 flavor to it. The best tea is produced in the first quarter of the year when the cool and dry weather sets in.
                  Teas hailing from Kandy produce bright infusions with coppery tones, and also has fair amounts of strength and body.
